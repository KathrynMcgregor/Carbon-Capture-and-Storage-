# Carbon-Capture-and-Storage-
3rd Year Research Project University of Nottingham 

I chose to do my third year research project on carbon capture and storage which was newly added to the curriculum. The topic was broad and I wasn't given a specific problem or question to answer. After initial research on carbon capture and storage methods I chose to investigate planting forests to create carbon sinks. I based my project on how best to do this. I then found data from the Woodland Carbon Code on UK trees, their growing conditions, and how much carbon they could sequest. 

•	Investigated the effect of growing conditions on different species’ ability to sequester carbon using data sourced from the Woodland Carbon Code 
•	Used MATLAB for data analysis and creation of plots 
•	Report writing consolidating the conclusions drawn from the data 
•	Project diary graded a 1st class (this was a physical diary so unfortunately can't be uploaded)
